# medical-agent
Just built an AI-powered medical report analyzer that helps people understand their lab results and medical reports in plain English.
The tool uses GPT-4 to break down complex medical jargon into easy-to-understand summaries, identify potential causes of abnormalities, and suggest practical next steps.
You can upload PDFs or images of your reports and get instant analysis. Perfect for preparing questions before doctor visits or simply understanding what your test results mean.
Built with Python, Streamlit, and CrewAI multi-agent system. The goal is to make healthcare information more accessible to everyone.
